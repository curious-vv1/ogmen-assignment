# Bot Control Package

This package provides functionality to visualize and control a robot in both RViz and Gazebo simulation environments.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- ROS 2 Humble
- Teleop Keyboard package (for manual robot control)
- Gazebo and RViz

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the package into your ROS 2 workspace (if not already present).

   ```bash
   cd ~/your_ros2_workspace/src
   git clone <repository_url>
## Usage

### Visualizing in RViz

To visualize the robot in RViz, run:

```bash
ros2 launch bot_control display.launch.py

### Simulating in Gazebo

To visualize the robot in the Gazebo simulation environment, run:

```bash
ros2 launch bot_control spawn.launch.py

### Controlling the Robot

To control the robot in the simulation, use the Teleop Keyboard package:

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard

Follow the on-screen instructions to send velocity commands to the robot.
